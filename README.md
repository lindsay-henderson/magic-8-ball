This is an app I made while getting familiar with the idea of state in react.  I enjoyed playing with conditional actions and styling based on state.

* button styling from MUI
* favicon is from [icons8](https://icons8.com/)
* 8 ball images are edited versions of graphics from [express.adobe.com](https://express.adobe.com/)
* Galaxy background is from [Canva.com](https://www.canva.com/)
